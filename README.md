![Molten Engine](Images/logo_light_transparent.png)
Molten started as spare-time engine project, which I eventually intend to use to develop my own games without relying on other engines. Hopefully you'll find a use for it too!

While parts of this project will inevitably be a classic case of re-inventing the wheel, I'm treating it as a chance to gain more experience in the area of game engine development.

# Android
Molten has recently been upgraded to .NET 7. To build for Android you will need to install the Android workloads by running  
```dotnet workload install android``` in command prompt or powershell. 

If you're upgrading from a previous .NET version, you may also need to run this command again to update the android workload.
